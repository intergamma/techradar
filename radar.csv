BetterCodeHub,adopt,tools,FALSE," .. "
TravisCI,hold,tools,FALSE,"At this moment we are migrating all builds to CircleCI because of better support of our current build flow"
CircleCI,adopt,tools,TRUE,"At this moment we are migrating all builds to CircleCI because of better support of our current build flow"
Dependabot,adopt,tools,TRUE," .. "
Atlassion Bamboo,hold,tools,FALSE,"We decided to favor Circle CI over Bamboo as its a SaaS service."
Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,adopt,techniques,TRUE," .. "
Architectural fitness function,adopt,techniques,TRUE," .. "
Previous release as failover,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Keeping the prior version as failover after a deployment could make our environment more resilient."
Java 10,hold,platforms,FALSE,"Java 10 has been marked end of live as of September 2018 by Oracle and will no longer be getting updates."
Java 11,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Java 11 is the new LTS Java version, so should be our primary target version."
Kotlin,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Due to it's interop with Java and it's low learning curve and it could be very interesting to let our dev's -optionally- exploit Kotlin's power."
Java 8,hold,platforms,FALSE,"Lacks container support and goes EoL January 2019."
OpenJDK,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Java development has been moved to OpenJDK."
OracleJDK,hold,platforms,FALSE,"OracleJDK will only have paid licenses for production use starting with Java 11."
Node.js,hold,platforms,FALSE,"At this moment we see no added value in favoring Node over Java for backend apps and we want to be wary for the last 10% trap."
Spring Boot 2,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE," .. "
Next.js,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE," .. "
Spring Boot 1,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We feel that we should migrate asap to Spring Boot 2 so that we can use Java 10 instead of 8, which lacks decent container support."
React,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"React has been selected as the preferred front-end framework and has been proven and tested."
ES.next,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"We use the latest ECMAScript features, using Babel for transpilation and polyfills where necessary."
OpenAPI,adopt,tools,TRUE,"OpenAPI based on Swagger offers good features for documenting APIs and optionally even generating parts of the API code (like DTOs). It helps non technical people to understand what Microservices can provide and, to some extend, do."
Hystrix,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"Hystrix is no longer in active development, and is currently in maintenance mode."
Resilience4j,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Resilience4j is a lightweight fault tolerance library inspired by Netflix Hystrix, but designed for Java 8 and functional programming. Lightweight, because the library only uses Vavr (formerly Javaslang), which does not have any other external library dependencies. Netflix Hystrix, in contrast, has a compile dependency to Archaius which has many more external library dependencies such as Guava and Apache Commons Configuration. With Resilience4j you don’t have to go all-in, you can pick what you need."
Event Driven Architecture,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"We want to respond to (data) changes in a timely manner, so they are reflected in all relevant systems as quickly as possible. In essense this means we prefer push over pull mechanisms, where applicable."
Grafana,hold,tools,TRUE,"Visualises data from multiple datasources (Elasticsearch, Prometheus, Newrelic, etc...) in a visually appealing and interactive way. Each team can create its own dashboards and configure alerts across datasources."
APIs as a product,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"When designing services intended to be used by various consumers it's generally a good idea to sit together with said consumers and agree upon the high-level API requirements first. The idea here is to align in terms of data requirements and method of interfacing, while leaving the design and data modelling up to the responsible team, with the intent of enabling them to create APIs that both fit the purpose of the consumer(s) and are general enough to be reused and adapted for other ends."
JQuery,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"As standards in the browser further mature and the use of React is increasing there is no real need for JQuery anymore. Also from a performance perspective JQuery can be a bottle neck."
Typescript,adopt,languages & frameworks, TRUE, "Adds type-safety to javascript. Huge win for React apps as props can be typechecked via interfaces. Helps with refactoring and understanding the code"
Serverless.com,adopt,languages & frameworks, FALSE, "Serverless.com or Serverless Framework is a platform agnostic product to manage serverless solutions and services from AWS, GCP and others"
New Relic,hold,tools, FALSE, "Tool focussing on Application Performance Management with limited logging and metrics functionality"
Datadog,adopt,tools, TRUE, "Datadog is a fully integrated monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform."
Trunk based development,adopt,techniques, FALSE, "A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’ *, resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after."
New Java framework approach,assess,languages & frameworks,TRUE, "Reevaluate our Java framework approach"
