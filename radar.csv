Dependabot,assess,tools,TRUE," .. "
Google AutoML Recommendations,trial,tools,TRUE,"Google's AutoML Recommendations is a machine learning based solution used for calculating cross sells and recommendations on the PDP and homepage. It is part of a suite of AutoML products for different problems like text recognition and image recognition."
Atlassion Bamboo,hold,tools,FALSE,"We decided to favor Circle CI over Bamboo as its a SaaS service."
Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,adopt,techniques,TRUE," .. "
Architectural fitness function,trial,techniques,TRUE," .. "
Previous release as failover,assess,techniques,TRUE,"Keeping the prior version as failover after a deployment could make our environment more resilient."
Java 10,hold,platforms,FALSE,"Java 10 has been marked end of live as of September 2018 by Oracle and will no longer be getting updates."
Java 11,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Java 11 is the new LTS Java version, so should be our primary target version."
Kotlin,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"Due to it's interop with Java and it's low learning curve and it could be very interesting to let our dev's -optionally- exploit Kotlin's power."
Java 8,hold,platforms,FALSE,"Lacks container support and goes EoL January 2019."
OpenJDK,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"Java development has been moved to OpenJDK."
OracleJDK,hold,platforms,FALSE,"OracleJDK will only have paid licenses for production use starting with Java 11."
Node.js,hold,platforms,FALSE,"At this moment we see no added value in favoring Node over Java for backend apps and we want to be wary for the last 10% trap."
Spring Boot 2,adopt,languages & frameworks,FALSE," .. "
Next.js,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE," .. "
Spring Boot 1,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"We feel that we should migrate asap to Spring Boot 2 so that we can use Java 10 instead of 8, which lacks decent container support."
React,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"React has been selected as the preferred front-end framework and has been proven and tested."
ES.next,adopt,languages & frameworks,TRUE,"We use the latest ECMAScript features, using Babel for transpilation and polyfills where necessary."
Event Driven Architecture,assess,techniques,TRUE,"We want to respond to (data) changes in a timely manner, so they are reflected in all relevant systems as quickly as possible. In essense this means we prefer push over pull mechanisms, where applicable."
Grafana,assess,tools,TRUE,"Visualises data from multiple datasources (Elasticsearch, Prometheus, Newrelic, etc...) in a visually appealing and interactive way. Each team can create its own dashboards and configure alerts across datasources."
APIs as a product,assess,techniques,TRUE,"When designing services intended to be used by various consumers it's generally a good idea to sit together with said consumers and agree upon the high-level API requirements first. The idea here is to align in terms of data requirements and method of interfacing, while leaving the design and data modelling up to the responsible team, with the intent of enabling them to create APIs that both fit the purpose of the consumer(s) and are general enough to be reused and adapted for other ends."
JQuery,hold,languages & frameworks,FALSE,"As standards in the browser further mature and the use of React is increasing there is no real need for JQuery anymore. Also from a performance perspective JQuery can be a bottle neck."
Typescript,assess,languages & frameworks, TRUE, "Adds type-safety to javascript. Huge win for React apps as props can be typechecked via interfaces. Helps with refactoring and understanding the code"
